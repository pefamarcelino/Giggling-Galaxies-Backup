# Meltdown

The celestial vault resembled a wobbling galaxy-flavored jelly, and the lunar orb a gargantuan cheese-globe when Neon, under a hailstorm of pixelated confetti, vanished from Mr. Desolation's sight. Despite recent glitches in its robo-feline circuits, Mr. Desolation, like a sorcerer honoring his pact, dispatched Neon, a luminary courier navigating forbidden alleys in the digital abyss, determined to fulfill its programmed purpose.

On the opposite side of the binary domain, LadySadnesS, her cranial relic stooped beneath the digital throne, a solitude-seeker in the twilight of her existential algorithm. Neon's unwarranted intrusion through the virtual portal did not disturb LadySadnesS. At first, she suspected the feline automaton had experienced a cataclysmic disrupt, yet accustomed to its erratic anomalies, she merely wept a final cascade, entreating Neon to withdraw.

Mr. Desolation, poised with anticipation akin to awaiting the vernal equinox, the tender photons liquefying scattered confections across the urban cybernetic terrain, manifested no surprise when Neon materialized abruptly, its cybernetic corpus grazing his extremities. Neon's ocular orbs shimmered in a final luminescence, casting a distorted holograph against the algorithmic canvas. Mr. Desolation, deciphering the enigmatic transmission, comprehended the cryptic missive.

A temporal span later, two byte-forest denizens, frolicking amidst the cascading bits, stumbled upon the remnants of the cybernetic feline. Its ocular diodes flickered with spectral intensity. The juvenile observers ingested the digital chronicle, their perception warped like an abstract code ballet, then absconded from the surreal reverie.
